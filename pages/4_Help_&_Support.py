    The Responsible AI (RAI) indicator provides transparency about the quality and trustworthiness

    - **Bias**: Does the document use fair and balanced language?
    - **Hallucination**: Does the document contain claims that can't be verified?
    - **Security**: How sensitive is the information in the document?
    
    These metrics help you make informed decisions about the document's content and use.

    After creating a document, you'll have the option to export it in two formats:

    2. **DOCX**: Microsoft Word format for further editing if needed
    
    Simply click the respective button in the document preview page to download your document.
